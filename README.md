# todi.lmms
Random notations generator for LMMS

[Todi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todi_(thaat)) is one of the [Thaat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaat) system in the classical musics.
I picked the name for this project from this Thaat, because it is easy to memorise.

Todi (ie. todi.lmms) generates Raag based classical notations (SARGAMs).
Later, these notations can be translated for use with LMMS Software through XML Midi Clip import feature.
An [intermediary software](https://github.com/anytizer/swar.lmms) is required to convert these classical notes into XML Midi Clip for LMMS.
