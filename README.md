# todi.lmms
Random notations generator for LMMS

Todi is one of the Thaat system in the classical musics.
I picked the name for this project from this Thaat, because it is easy to memorise.

Todi generates Raag based classical notations (SARGAMs).
These notations can be translated for use with LMMS Software.
