# todi.lmms
Random SARGAMS notations generator (intended to use with LMMS)

This is an experimental product.

[Todi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todi_(thaat)) is one of the [Thaat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaat) system in the classical musics.
I picked the name for this project from this Thaat, because it is easy to remember.

Todi (ie. todi.lmms) generates Random SARGAM notations.
Later, these notations can be translated for use with LMMS Software through XML Midi Clip import feature.
An [intermediary software](https://github.com/anytizer/swar.lmms) can convert these notes into XML Midi Clip for LMMS.

Being random notes, they are unpredictable. But since flow of notations stays within the notes range defined by a [Raag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raga), it might feel melodious. Here is one sample of such melody: [Computer Sings](https://github.com/anytizer/melodies.lmms/tree/main/melodies/Computer-Sings-01/project/).

It is all about randomizing notes; I am not sure if the output is perfect.
Once notes are generated, you can try various parameters with LMMS.

Decompilation of this software is **Allowed**!

* Try the binary file from the release.
* You need the .net 7 or later version of the framework.
