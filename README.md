# todi.lmms
Random notations generator for LMMS.

This is an experimental product.

[Todi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todi_(thaat)) is one of the [Thaat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaat) system in the classical musics.
I picked the name for this project from this Thaat, because it is easy to memorise.

Todi (ie. todi.lmms) generates Raag based classical notations (SARGAMs).
Later, these notations can be translated for use with LMMS Software through XML Midi Clip import feature.
An [intermediary software](https://github.com/anytizer/swar.lmms) is required to convert these classical notes into XML Midi Clip for LMMS.

Being random notes, they are unpredictable. But since flow of notations stays within the notes range defined by a [Raag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raga), it feels melodious. Here is one sample of such melody: [Computer Sings](https://github.com/anytizer/melodies.lmms/tree/main/melodies/Computer-Sings-01/project/).

It is all about randomizing notes; I am not sure if the output is perfect or not.
Try changing tempo, adding other beats, drums and enhacnce yourself with your LMMS and melody skills.

Decompilation of this software is **Allowed**!

* yes, because the source code is dirty with lots of comments, links to articles etc.
* Try the binary file from the release.
* You need the .net 7 or later version of the framework.
* Produce your own SARGAMs.
